Open the project in your IDE.
Add it as maven project.
Configure Tomcat:
* add artifact
* add sdk 11.0.3
Add sdk 11.0.3 in project stru—Åture.
Use file /mate/academy/internetshop/src/main/resources/init_db.sql to create schema and all the tables required by this app in MySQL database.
At /mate/academy/internetshop/src/main/java/mate/academy/internetshop/util/ConnectionUtil.class set username and password for your DB to create a Connection.
Change a path in /mate/academy/internetshop/src/main/resources/log4j.properties. It has to reach your logFile.
Run the project.

If you first time launch this project: 
 * Run InjectDataController by URL = .../inject-data to create default users and products.

By default there are: 
 * one user with an USER role (login = "user", password = "1111") 
 * one user with an ADMIN role (login = "admin", password = "1111")
 * one product with (name = "product-1", price = 10.0) 
 * one product with (name = "product-2", price = 11.0) 
 
 To test the application without creating a database, you must change all Dao implementations from dao.jdbc package to 
 all implementation from dao.impl package.
